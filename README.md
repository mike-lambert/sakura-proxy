# Sakura: Local Proxy

Sakura is a local SOCKS5 server, which routes traffic over Tor network in order anonymize it and circumvent censorship.
It was designed as "Emergency Kit" in order to access Telegram Messenger while you have not access to any proxy server on network.

Just run, switch on, and click "Enable proxy".

Sakura incorporates code of ORBot in order to access Tor, and patched sources of Orchid library as a fallback.
Both works.
